# Honeybird

This is my replacement to [kbhomes/radiant-player-mac](https://github.com/kbhomes/radiant-player-mac) which is currently broken due to the redesign.

This project was hacked together in an about 45mins so don't expect anything grand. 

Honeybird is built on [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) so in theory this should support Windows and Linux, i can't gurantee the shortcut keys will work on all platforms (let me know if they're not).

All feedback welcome.
